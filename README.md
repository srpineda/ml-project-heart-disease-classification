# Machine Learning Project: Heart Disease Classification

* This is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease based on his/her medical attributes.

* Matplotlib was used for data visualization and Scikit-Learn's estimators for modeling.

* `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV` were used to tune hyperparameters.

* Scikit-Learn's `LogisticRegression` estimator produced the highest cross-validated accuracy score of 83% compared to `KNeighborsClassifier` and `RandomForestClassifier`.

* The features with the most impact to the model are *sex*, *exercise induced angina (exang)*, *chest pain type (cp)*, *thalassemia (thal)*, and *number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (ca)*.
